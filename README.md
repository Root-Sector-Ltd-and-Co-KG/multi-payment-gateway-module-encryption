# Multi-Payment Gateway Encryption Module

This module provides encryption functionality for the Multi-Payment Gateway system, offering a comprehensive suite of encryption services including field-level encryption, key management, and audit logging.

## Import Structure

This module uses the following import path structure:

```go
import "github.com/root-sector/multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption/[package]"
```

Where `[package]` is one of:

- `audit`: Audit logging for encryption operations
- `cache`: Cache functionality for encryption operations
- `coordinator`: Coordinates between different encryption components
- `dbencryption`: Database-specific encryption functionality
- `dek`: Data Encryption Key management
- `field`: Field-level encryption functionality
- `interfaces`: Common interfaces used across the module
- `kms`: Key Management System integrations
- `types`: Common types used across the module

## Features

### Field-Level Encryption

- Secure encryption of sensitive data fields
- Support for different encryption algorithms
- Configurable encryption policies
- Searchable encryption capabilities

### Key Management

- Support for multiple KMS providers:
  - AWS KMS
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Google Cloud KMS
  - HashiCorp Vault Transit
- Data Encryption Key (DEK) management
- Key rotation and versioning
- Secure key storage and retrieval

### Caching

- Performance-optimized caching for DEKs
- Configurable cache policies
- Cache statistics and monitoring

### Audit Logging

- Comprehensive audit trails for encryption operations
- Secure logging of sensitive operations
- Integration with standard logging frameworks

### Database Encryption

- Database-specific encryption implementations
- Secure storage of encrypted data
- Efficient querying of encrypted data

## Usage

### Local Development

Add the following to your `go.mod` file:

```go
replace github.com/root-sector/multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption => ../multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption
```

### Production

Use the standard Go module dependency mechanism:

```go
require github.com/root-sector/multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption v0.1.0
```

## Directory Structure

- `audit/`: Audit logging for encryption operations
- `cache/`: Cache management for DEK and other encryption components
- `coordinator/`: Coordination between different encryption components
- `dbencryption/`: Database-specific encryption functionality
- `dek/`: Data Encryption Key management
- `field/`: Field-level encryption functionality
- `interfaces/`: Common interfaces used across the module
- `kms/`: Key Management Service interfaces and implementations
  - `credentials/`: KMS provider-specific credential management
- `types/`: Common types used across the encryption module

## Dependencies

The module requires Go 1.24.1 or later and includes the following major dependencies:

- `github.com/hashicorp/go-kms-wrapping/v2`: Core KMS functionality
- `github.com/rs/zerolog`: Structured logging
- `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/v2`: MongoDB support
- Various cloud provider SDKs for KMS integration

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter import errors like:

```
could not import github.com/root-sector/multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption/... (no required module provides package "github.com/root-sector/multi-payment-gateway-module-encryption/...")
```

Make sure that:

1. You've properly set up the `replace` directive in your `go.mod` for local development
2. You've run `go mod tidy` to update dependencies
3. The package name and path match the expected structure in this module
4. You're using a compatible Go version (1.24.1 or later)

## Security Considerations

- All encryption operations are audited
- Keys are never stored in plaintext
- Support for key rotation and versioning
- Integration with enterprise-grade KMS providers
- Configurable security policies
- Regular security updates and patches

## Contributing

When contributing to this module:

1. Follow the existing code structure and patterns
2. Ensure all new features are properly documented
3. Include appropriate tests for new functionality
4. Update the README.md when adding new features
5. Follow security best practices for encryption implementations
